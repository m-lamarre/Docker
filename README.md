# Docker - A [*We Think Code*](http://www.wethinkcode.co.za/) School Project

### Docker-1 (macOS flavored)

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud.

Docker was created to satisfy this need for unification and normalisation: it makes it possible to split an application into several microservices, light, adaptable, universal and scalable, and it also gives the system administrators a great flexibility to deploy and scale up the app.

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment.
